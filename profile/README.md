**Solana Security Research & Defense Tools**

## Who We Are

EMET Labs is a security research organization dedicated to protecting the Solana ecosystem. We build open-source defense tools and conduct research into attack patterns targeting Solana users, protocols, and infrastructure.

## Our Mission

The Solana ecosystem moves fast and so do attackers. From transaction-level exploits to protocol vulnerabilities, users and developers face threats that are difficult to detect and even harder to explain. We exist to build practical defenses and make security accessible to everyone in the ecosystem.

## Projects

### [EMET Guardian](https://github.com/EmetLabs/Emet-guardian)

Our first tool, a Chrome browser extension that intercepts and analyzes Solana transactions in real-time.

**Features:**
- Transaction interception before signing
- Deterministic risk analysis with auditable rules
- Detection of permission exploits, authority transfers, and drain patterns
- Human-readable threat warnings
- 100% local analysis, no data leaves your browser

## Our Approach

- **Deterministic Detection:**  No ML black boxes. Every rule is auditable and predictable.
- **Privacy First:**  All analysis happens locally. We don't collect user data.
- **Open Source:**  Security tools should be transparent and verifiable.
- **Practical Focus:**  We build tools that solve real problems, not theoretical ones.

## Research Areas

- Transaction-level exploit patterns
- Protocol security architecture
- Program vulnerability analysis
- Attack vector documentation

## Get Involved

- **Report Vulnerabilities:**  Found an attack pattern we should know about? Open an issue.
- **Contribute:**  PRs welcome. Check individual repo contribution guidelines.
- **Research Collaboration:**  Reach out for security research partnerships.
